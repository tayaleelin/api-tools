## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To make use of the tools in this repository, you should have:

- **Basic knowledge of APIs**: Understanding of RESTful services, HTTP methods, and status codes.
- **Programming Language**: Depending on the script, familiarity with languages like Python, JavaScript, or Bash.
- **Tools**: Some scripts may require external tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Curl](https://curl.se/).
